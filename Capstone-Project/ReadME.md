# 📊 IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

---

## Project Overview

This capstone project represents the **culmination of the **[IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst?authMode=organizationsignup)**, bringing together data collection, preparation, analysis, visualization, and presentation into a single end-to-end workflow.

The objective is to simulate a **real-world data analyst engagement**, where raw data is transformed into insights and communicated through visuals and dashboards to support decision-making.

---

## Key Objectives

- Collect data from external sources (APIs and web data)
- Clean, normalize, and prepare datasets for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns
- Visualize findings using appropriate charts and comparisons
- Build dashboards to summarize and communicate insights
- Present results in a clear, stakeholder-ready format

---

## Workflow

This project follows a structured analytics lifecycle:

1. **Data Collection**  
   External data sourcing using programmatic methods

2. **Data Wrangling**  
   Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies

3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   Distribution analysis, correlation exploration, and outlier detection

4. **Visualization**  
   Comparing relationships, compositions, and trends across variables

5. **Dashboarding**  
   Creating consolidated views for insight delivery

6. **Presentation**  
   Communicating findings through reports and visual summaries

---

## Repository Contents

- **Jupyter notebooks** for each stage of the analysis
- **Web scraping and API notebooks**
- **Exploratory and visualization labs**
- **Final dashboard and presentation materials**
- **Capstone presentation (PDF)**

---

## Tools & Technologies
