## Overview

This folder contains an applied Python project completed as part of the **[IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst)**. The project demonstrates an **end-to-end data workflow**, from data acquisition to analysis and visualization, using real-world financial datasets.

The emphasis of this work is on **data extraction, transformation, and exploratory analysis**, rather than predictive modeling.

---

## Analytical Focus

The project focuses on:

- Programmatic data acquisition from multiple sources  
- Combining structured and semi-structured datasets  
- Cleaning and organizing time-series data  
- Exploring trends and patterns through visualization  
- Communicating insights through clear analytical outputs  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data extraction using Python libraries  
- Web data collection and parsing  
- Data wrangling with Pandas  
- Working with time-series financial data  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizing trends for comparative analysis  

---

## Folder Contents

- **Jupyter notebook(s)** containing the full analytical workflow  
- **Data processing and visualization outputs**  
- **README.md** documenting scope and methodology  

Files are organized to reflect a realistic analyst workflow, from raw data ingestion to insight generation.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **BeautifulSoup**
- **yfinance**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📌 Notes

- The project emphasizes **analytical reasoning and data handling**, not investment recommendations  
- All analyses are intended for **educational and portfolio purposes only**
