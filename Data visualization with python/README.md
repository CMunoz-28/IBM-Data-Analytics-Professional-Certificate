# 📊 Data Visualization with Python

---

## Overview

This folder contains hands-on data visualization and dashboarding work completed as part of the **[IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst)**. The focus is on transforming raw data into **clear, interpretable visual insights** using Python’s visualization ecosystem.

Projects emphasize **chart selection, visual storytelling, interactivity, and exploratory analysis**, progressing from static plots to interactive dashboards.

---

## Focus

The work in this folder demonstrates:

- Creating effective charts for exploratory analysis  
- Comparing distributions and trends across variables  
- Designing statistical and regression visualizations  
- Building geospatial visualizations and maps  
- Developing interactive dashboards for monitoring performance  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data visualization best practices  
- Chart design and storytelling  
- Statistical plotting and trend analysis  
- Interactive visualization development  
- Dashboard layout and component design  
- Translating metrics into actionable insights  

---

## Folder Contents

- **Jupyter notebooks** for visualization techniques and exploratory plots  
- **Python scripts** for dashboard and interactive components  
- **Final visualization project** applying multiple visualization methods  
- **README.md** documenting scope and approach  

Files are organized to reflect a natural progression from static visual analysis to interactive dashboards.
