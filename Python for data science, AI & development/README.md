## 📌 Overview

This folder contains Python-based analytical exercises completed as part of the **[IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst)**. The work demonstrates foundational programming concepts and their application to **data manipulation, analysis, and data collection workflows** commonly used in analytics roles.

The focus is on building a strong Python foundation that supports later work in **data analysis, visualization, and modeling**.

---

## Analytical Focus

Work in this folder emphasizes:

- Core Python programming for analytics  
- Structured thinking using functions and control flow  
- Working with common data structures  
- Reading, writing, and processing data files  
- Using Python libraries for data analysis  
- Collecting data from external sources via APIs  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python syntax and programming fundamentals  
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets)  
- Control flow, functions, and modular code  
- File handling and data ingestion  
- Data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy  
- API interaction and basic web data collection  

---

## Folder Contents

- **Jupyter notebooks** illustrating incremental Python concepts  
- **Practice exercises** applying programming logic to data tasks  
- **README.md** documenting scope and intent  

Files are organized to reflect a progression from Python fundamentals to applied data workflows.

---

## Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Requests / API libraries**

---

## 📌 Notes

- Emphasis is placed on **programming fundamentals and analytical thinking**, not advanced machine learning  
- This work serves as a foundation for downstream analytics and data science projects
