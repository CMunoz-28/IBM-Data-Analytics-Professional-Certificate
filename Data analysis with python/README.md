# 📊 Data Analysis with Python

---

## Overview

This folder contains applied data analysis and modeling work completed as part of the **[IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst)**. The projects demonstrate how Python is used to **explore datasets, engineer features, build regression models, and evaluate model performance** in a structured analytical workflow.

The emphasis is on **analytical reasoning, model interpretation, and data-driven insight generation**, rather than production-grade machine learning.

---

## Analytical Focus

The work in this folder focuses on:

- Importing and understanding structured datasets  
- Data cleaning and preparation for analysis  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation assessment  
- Feature scaling and transformation  
- Regression model development  
- Model evaluation and refinement  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data wrangling with Pandas  
- Exploratory analysis and visualization  
- Linear and regularized regression techniques  
- Feature engineering and scaling  
- Model performance evaluation and interpretation  
- Iterative model refinement  

---

## Folder Contents

- **Jupyter notebooks** documenting step-by-step analytical workflows  
- **Final analytical project notebook** applying EDA and modeling end-to-end  
- **README.md** describing scope and methodology  

Files are organized to reflect a realistic analyst workflow, from initial data inspection to validated model results.

---

## Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📌 Notes

- The focus is on **interpretable modeling and analytical rigor**, not advanced ML pipelines  
- All datasets are used for **educational and portfolio demonstration purposes only**
