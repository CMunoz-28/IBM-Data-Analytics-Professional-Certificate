# Databases & SQL for Data Science with Python

---

## Overview

This folder contains applied database and SQL analysis work completed as part of the **[IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst)**. The work demonstrates how relational databases and SQL queries are used to **extract, join, and analyze structured data**, with Python serving as the execution and analysis environment.

The emphasis is on **analytical querying and data reasoning**, not database administration.

---

## Analytical Focus

The work in this folder focuses on:

- Loading structured datasets into relational databases  
- Writing SQL queries to retrieve and combine data across tables  
- Using joins, filters, aggregations, and subqueries  
- Executing SQL from Python-based environments  
- Analyzing query results to support data-driven insights  

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- SQL querying (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING)  
- Working with relational database schemas  
- Combining multiple datasets through joins  
- Query-based data exploration and validation  
- Integrating SQL workflows within Python notebooks  

---

## Folder Contents

- **Jupyter notebooks** containing SQL queries and analysis  
- **Database-connected workflows** executed via Python  
- **README.md** documenting scope and analytical intent  

Files are organized to reflect a realistic analyst workflow from raw data access to insight generation.

---

## Tools Used

- **SQL**
- **Python**
- **SQLite / DB2 (course environment)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📌 Notes

- This work emphasizes **data querying and analytical logic**, not system-level database management  
- All datasets are used strictly for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes

_This material is included for portfolio and skills demonstration purposes as part of a professional certification._
